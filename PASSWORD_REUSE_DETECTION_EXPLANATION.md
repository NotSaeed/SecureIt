# Password Reuse Detection - How It Works

## Overview
The SecureIt password analyzer now includes sophisticated cross-site password reuse detection that alerts users when they're using the same password across different websites, which is a major security risk.

## How Password Reuse Detection Works

### 1. Real-Time Analysis
- When you type in a password field, the analyzer checks the password against your SecureIt vault
- It compares the current website's domain with the domains of all vault entries that have the same password
- The analysis happens automatically after a 500ms delay to avoid excessive API calls

### 2. Domain Extraction and Comparison
```javascript
// Current implementation extracts clean domain names
extractDomainFromUrl("https://www.facebook.com/login") ‚Üí "facebook.com"
extractDomainFromUrl("https://secure.bankofamerica.com") ‚Üí "secure.bankofamerica.com"
```

### 3. Cross-Site Detection Logic
The analyzer distinguishes between two scenarios:

#### Scenario A: Same-Site Password (Purple Circle)
- Password exists in vault for the same domain
- Shows purple circle with pulse animation
- Message: "‚úì Saved in vault: [Account Name]"
- **Less concerning** - normal vault behavior

#### Scenario B: Cross-Site Reuse (Red Circle - Fast Pulse)
- Password exists in vault for different domain(s)
- Shows red circle with urgent fast pulse animation
- Message examples:
  - "‚ö†Ô∏è Also used on: gmail.com"
  - "‚ö†Ô∏è Also used on: facebook.com, twitter.com"
  - "‚ö†Ô∏è Used on 5 other sites: gmail.com, facebook.com, twitter.com..."
- **High security risk** - immediate attention needed

### 4. Visual Indicators

| Circle Color | Animation | Meaning |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| üî¥ Red (Fast Pulse) | `pulse-red-urgent 1.5s` | Password reused across different sites |
| üî¥ Red (Normal Pulse) | `pulse-red 2s` | Password found in data breaches |
| üü† Orange | `pulse-orange 2s` | Weak password |
| üü° Yellow | None | Moderate password strength |
| üü¢ Green | None | Strong password |
| üü£ Purple | `pulse-purple 2s` | Password saved for this same site |

### 5. Backend Integration
The analyzer calls the SecureIt vault API to:
```php
// Check if password exists in user's vault
POST /backend/api/extension.php
{
    "action": "check_password_in_vault",
    "password": "[user_password]",
    "url": "[current_page_url]"
}

// Returns all vault items with matching password
{
    "success": true,
    "in_vault": true,
    "matched_items": [
        {
            "id": "123",
            "name": "Facebook Account",
            "url": "https://facebook.com",
            "username": "user@email.com"
        },
        {
            "id": "456", 
            "name": "Gmail Account",
            "url": "https://gmail.com",
            "username": "user@email.com"
        }
    ]
}
```

### 6. Security Benefits

#### Immediate Risk Awareness
- Users see instant visual feedback when reusing passwords
- Clear indication of which other sites use the same password
- Encourages immediate action to improve security

#### Cross-Site Protection
- Detects reuse across completely different domains
- Helps prevent credential stuffing attacks
- Reduces impact of single-site breaches

#### Seamless Password Generation
- Click the circle to instantly generate a new, unique password
- One-click fill into the current password field
- Eliminates friction in creating secure passwords

### 7. Technical Implementation Details

#### Domain Normalization
```javascript
// Handles various URL formats consistently
"https://www.example.com/login" ‚Üí "example.com"
"http://subdomain.site.org/page" ‚Üí "subdomain.site.org"
"example.com" ‚Üí "example.com"
```

#### Efficient API Calls
- Debounced input (500ms delay)
- Single API call per password analysis
- Cached domain extraction

#### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Works in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari
- Uses standard Web APIs (fetch, crypto.subtle)
- Fallback error handling

### 8. Test Scenarios

To test the password reuse detection:

1. **Setup**: Save passwords for different websites in your SecureIt vault
2. **Test Cross-Site Reuse**: 
   - Go to a banking site test page
   - Enter a password you've saved for social media
   - Should see red circle with fast pulse
3. **Test Same-Site Match**:
   - Enter a password you've saved for the current site
   - Should see purple circle
4. **Test Unique Password**:
   - Enter a new, strong password
   - Should see green circle

### 9. Privacy and Security

#### Local Processing
- Domain extraction happens locally in browser
- No sensitive data sent to external services (except HaveIBeenPwned for breach checks)

#### Encrypted Vault Storage
- All vault passwords remain encrypted
- Password comparison happens server-side with user authentication
- No passwords stored in browser memory longer than necessary

#### Minimal Data Exposure
- Only domain names and encrypted vault data processed
- No plaintext passwords logged or stored client-side
